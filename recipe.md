Time to start making the dish!
Preparing the Pasta:
    1.) Take a pan, and fill it with water halfway.
    2.) Put the water of the stove and use the medium flame.
    3.) When the water starts to boil, put 1 cup of pasta (any type fine, I prefer penne).
    4.) Add a pinch of salt, and leave it to boil for 8 - 10 min.

We'll take another pan for making the sauce.
Preparing The Sauce:
    1.) Take 5-6 medium sized tomatoes and make a paste.
    2.) Put 1 tbs of olive oil in your pan.
    3.) Chop one onion, one bellpepper and one carrot.
    4.) Put these in the oil and saute for 2-3 minutes.
    5.) Put the tomato paste in the mixture and add salt to taste.
    6.) Add half tsp italian seasoning and heat for 5 minutes until it starts bubbling.

By this time, the pasta shells should be perfectly cooked.
    1.) Strain the pasta, then wash it with cold water.
    2.) Put the pasta in the tomato sauce. Remember to mix it well.
    
 Now, the pasta is almost done! Before you serve it, put cheese on top of your creation, as well as some seasoning. 
 Mariana Pasta, done!
